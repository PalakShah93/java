## Class :

 Class is a template in which we can define objects. One class can have many opjects.  

## Object : 

It consists of Attribute and Behaviour. Attributes/state ( datatypes ) and Behaviour (Methods)
Example: Mobile is a `class`. color, price, brand, module ID are some of the attributes of module. Call, message, facecall etc are           some of the behaviour.  
```
class mobile{ //this is called creating a class

double price; // declaring variables /State of mobile
String color,brand,moduleID;

public void call(){ // creating a method which is basically a behaviour. 

}

public void message(){

}

}
```
